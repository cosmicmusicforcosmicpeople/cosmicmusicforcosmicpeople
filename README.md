Hello Humanoids! I'm currently enrolled in the Software Development bootcamp with Tech Elevator. Currently, I am learning about the basics and fundamentals of coding through their prework. I look forward in collaborating with as many people that are willing to do so. I'm looking for any advice that will aid me on my journey. Feel free to ask any questions, and you can reach me at my email electricburgerland@gmail.com. My pronouns are He/Him and I have many passions in following fields: photography, graphic design, coffee, death metal music, and the cosmos.
